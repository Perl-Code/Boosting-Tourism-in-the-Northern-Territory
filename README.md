## Addressing the NT Tourism Problem

### Why are people hesitant to visit NT?

The Northern Territory's recovery of international visitors has been slower than the national average. This slower recovery is attributed to the Territory's unique placement in international itineraries for Australia. There is still significant capacity outside of the traditional peak season, affecting international visitor numbers[1].

Domestic travel to the NT is recovering, but it remains below pre-pandemic levels. In 2023, the NT saw a 10.5% drop in domestic visitors compared to 2022, and a 19.4% decrease in interstate visitors compared to pre-pandemic levels[1].
